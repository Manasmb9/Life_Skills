## Question 2:

* Restating and clarifying what the other has said, not asking questions or telling what the listener feels, believes, or wants.
* Trying to understand the feelings contained in what the other is saying, not just the facts or ideas.
* Responding with acceptance and empathy, not with indifference, cold objectivity, or fake concern.

## Question 3:
#### What are the obstacles in your listening process?
Listening Barriers
* Noise. Any external noise can be a barrier, like the sound of equipment running, phones ringing, or other people having conversation
* Visual distractions. 
* The person listening may become distracted by the other person’s personal appearance, mannerisms, voice, or gestures. 
* Self-centeredness. This causes the listener to focus on his or her own thoughts rather than the speaker’s words.
* Mental laziness. Laziness creates an unwillingness to listen to complex or detailed information.
* Sense of superiority. This leads the listener to believe they have nothing to learn from the speaker.
* Cognitive dissonance. The listener hears only what he or she expects or molds the speaker’s message to conform with their own beliefs.
Impatience. A listener can become impatient with a speaker who talks slowly or draws out the message.
