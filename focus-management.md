## Question 1:
#### What is Deep Work?
Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. 
It’s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time.

Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. 
In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people 
have lost the ability to go deep—spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there’s a better way.
## Question 2:
#### Paraphrase all the ideas in the videos and this one in detail.
Newport gives a number of tips that helps you create time and space for getting in the flow state. These are the ones I found most salient.
* Optimal Duration : cal pointed out to work for 1 hour focused mode.
* Give yourself a strict period of time to spend working. This limits burnout, work creep, and keeps you focused and urgent on your work.
* Use commutes, exercise, cleaning or other repetitive tasks to work out concepts.
* Notice Your Shallow Work to Better Avoid It.
* complete the work before Deadlines 
* Focus on the wildly important. 
* Act on lead measures .
* Keep a compelling scoreboard.
  
## Question 3:
#### How can you implement the principles in your day to day life?
Organize Your Deep Work
The first element of deep work starts with the recognition of your limited willpower. That means, you won’t have the mental discipline 
to stay concentrated on a single task unless you prepare your mind and environment to it.
* Develop a Deep Work Schedule and Routine:  
Deep work is, by definition, a hard task, as it pushes your cognitive abilities to greater lengths. A systematic way of getting 
in that deep work mindset is to develop a routine in which you always perform the task in the same place and time, for a given time frame.
* Work on What Matters.
* Concentrate Your Energy.
* Take Breaks.
* Schedule Tight Deadlines.
* Meditate
* Define Your Personal and Professional Goals
* Define Your Key Activities
* Try It for 30 Days


## Question 4:
#### Your key takeaways from the video
* Cal suggests. Social media is simply a source of entertainment, and an unsavoury one at that. 
 There are many forms of entertainment out there. He describes it as a 'slot machine for your phone'. 
* Social Media companies actually employ 'attention engineers'. It's there job, to make and keep you addicted. 
All in aid of maximising profit from attention and data. 
* The excessive use of social media, any of our digital devices throughout the day actually, 
fragments our attention, permanently reducing the brain’s ability to concentrate on the deep work people need to do to be successful.
* The potential harms Newport points out are - fragmented attention, reduction in concentration/focus (long-term as well as short), feelings of loneliness and isolation, inadequacy, depression… and a pervasive background hum of anxiety. 
* He finishes up with that we should treat our attention with respect and that intensity can be traded for time. 
Shorter periods of focused work can not only get more done with higher quality but also give you far more free time to do the things you love.
