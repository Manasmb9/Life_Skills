## Question 1
#### What is your one major takeaway from each one of the 6 sections. So 6 points in total.
* Make sure to ask questions and seek clarity in the meeting itself. Since most of the times, it will be difficult to get the same set of people online again
* Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, receive the call and inform them you will call in back in 5-10 min, and call them back. This is a much better alternative than letting it go down as a missed call
* The way you ask a question determines whether it will be answered or not. 
You need to make it very easy for the person to answer your question. Messages like the database is not connecting, need your help or the build is not working, can you help me out, will not get you the answers you are looking for.
* Join the meetings 5-10 mins early to get some time with your team members.
* Remember they have their own work to do as well. Pick and choose your communication medium depending on the situation.
* Work when you work, play when you play is a good thumb rule.
## Question 2
#### Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area? 
Work when you work, play when you play is a good thumb rule
* I will maintain a schedule to work and to play.
* Make sure that no disturbances should occur while working.
* Concentrate on the work in the working hours avoid unwanted communication.
* Make sure to not to divert to another activity while working.
* when I wanted to play I will put my work tensions aside.
