## Question 1:
### What is the Feynman Technique?
#### Feynman Technique
The Feynman Technique is a method of learning that unleashes your potential and forces you to develop a deep understanding.

#### Advantages of Feynman Technique
- Complete Understanding
- Improves Teaching Skills
- Develops and Enhances Critical thinking abilities.
- Simplified Learning
#### There are four key steps to the Feynman Technique:

* **Step 1:** Grab a sheet of paper and write the name of the concept at the top.
* **Step 2:** Explain the concept in your own words as if you were teaching it to someone else. 
* **Step 3:** Review your explanation and identify the areas where you didn’t know something or where you feel your explanation is shaky. Once you've pinpointed them, go back to the source material and notes, or any examples you can find in order to shore up our understanding.
* **Step 4:** If there are any areas in your explanation where you’ve used lots of technical terms or complex language, challenge yourself to re-write these sections in simpler terms.

## Question 2:
### What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?
#### There are four ways to implement this technique:

* **Stage 1** is Teach to a Child this is where it is advised that the students should make a 12-year-old understand the concepts of the subject. 
* **Stage 2** is reviewing whatever has been learned. This step is important to analyze the gaps in learning.
* **Stage 3** is to organize your thoughts and simplify the learning. This step includes taking notes  
* **Stage 4** is transmitting the knowledge to one another. 

## Question 3:
### Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words?

* The brain has two modes of thinking that Dr. Oakley simplifies as *focused* in which learners concentrate on the material, and *diffuse* a neural resting state in which consolidation occurs ,that is, the new information can settle into the brain. 

* To accomplish those periods of focused and diffuse-mode thinking, Dr. Oakley recommends what is known as the Pomodoro Technique, developed by one Francesco Cirillo.  

* Dr. Oakley teaches that even thinking about doing things we dislike activates the pain centers of the brain. The Pomodoro Technique, she said,helps the mind slip into focus and begin work without thinking about the work.

* Dr. Oakley urges her students to understand that people learn in different ways. Those who have “racecar brains” snap up information; those with “hiker brains” take longer to assimilate information but, like a hiker, perceive more details along the way. 

## Question 4:
### What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

1. Use recall. 
2. Test yourself.   
3. Take breaks. 
4. Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies. 
5. Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer, and then turn on a timer for twenty-five minutes. 
6. Do the hardest thing earliest in the day, when you are fresh.
7. Make a mental contrast. 

## Question 5
### Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.
Research suggests it takes 10,000 hours to develop a new skill to mastery.
**Kaufman says:**
If you can invest 20 hours to learn your new skill, this will help you get over the initial “frustration barrier.”   It’s this “frustration barrier” that holds so many people back from learning new things, exploring new interests, or realizing their potential.
**In order to learn any skill in 20 hours, Josh offers a four-step process with advice from his own experience**
* Deconstruct the skill
* Learn enough to self-correct
* Remove practice barriers
* Practice at least 20 hours

## Question 6
### What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?
* **Deconstruct the skill**
By analyzing the skill and breaking it down into smaller parts, it is easier to identify and learn the building blocks of the desired skill.  For example, if I wanted to learn how to program a robot, I might want to learn about electricity, a specific computer programming language, and the basics of physics. By learning this smaller set of skills, I would be more prepared to achieve my desired complex skill of programming a robot.
* **Learn enough to self-correct**
In the event of learning a new skill, independently, it is important to learn just enough to be able to self-correct. Being able to identify errors and fix mistakes is a critical assessment tool when trying to learn something new.  
* **Remove practice barriers**
Another key part of this process is to remove practice barriers that might interfere with the learning. In this case, a barrier could be considered anything that would be a distraction to practicing the skill. Some barriers could include watching television, playing on cell phones, listening to music, or just hanging out with friends. Therefore, it is important to set aside undivided time that is dedicated to practicing the skill.  
* **Practice at least 20 hours**
The last piece of advice that Josh offers is to simply practice at least 20 hours.  Based on his research, he has found that 20 hours is the magic number to become proficient in a skill.
