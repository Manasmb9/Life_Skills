## Question 1:
### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
#### Verbal Harassment
* Making sexual jokes.
* Repeated compliments of an employee's appearance.
* Commenting on the attractiveness of others in front of an employee.
* Discussing someone's sex life in front of a colleague.
* Interrogating an employee about their sex life.
* Spreading sexual rumours about a colleague.
#### Physical Harrasment
* Repeating hugs or other types of unwanted touching.
* Staring at someone or repeated lingering glances
* Leaving unwanted gifts of a sexual or romantic nature.
* Leaving inappropriate and suggestive notes.
* Blocking someone from moving freely through the workplace.
#### Digital Harassment
In this digital age, people use the internet, email, text messages, and social media at work and home as a central form of communication.
This means that a perpetrator of sexual harassment can now send someone links to sexually charged material any time of the day or night. 
All of these forms of digital communications are sexual harassment if the recipient does not welcome them.
## Question 2:
#### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
* If I witness workplace harassment, I would tell my employer or I will tell the harasser that his or her behavior is not funny and must stop.
* If possible, I will document the situation. Take photos or videos with my phone and Ask the person being harassed if it's OK to film the incident.
* I will report what happened to local organizations related to harassment in general, or to targeted advocacy groups.
#### How to Help Someone Being Harassed
* **Make it known that you see what is happening:** Look at the harasser, make eye contact, or move closer to the person being harassed. 
If you feel the situation is safe enough, place yourself in between the harasser and their target.
* **Talk to the person being harassed:** Sit or stand next to them, and start any kind of friendly conversation with them. 
Let them know you're there to help. Try to ignore the harasser. 
In some cases, this may diffuse the situation and make the harasser go away.
* **Respond directly:** If you feel safe, directly confront the harasser. 
Simply say something like "That's not cool," or, "Please leave them alone." 
This can help sometimes, but there is also a possibility that a direct confrontation will escalate the situation.
* **Make suggestions, not demands:** Allow the person being harassed to remain in control of the situation. 
Make suggestions like "Would you like to sit next to me?" and don't tell them what to do.
* **Evaluate for safety:** See if there is somewhere safer you can go, like a different train car, for example. 
You can see if there is anyone else around you who will be able to help. There is safety in numbers.
* **Document the situation:** If possible, document the situation. Take photos or videos with your phone. 
Ask the person being harassed if it's OK to film the incident. This can help later if the incident becomes a legal matter.
* **Report the incident:** After everything is over, it may be helpful to report what happened to local organizations 
related to harassment in general, 
or to targeted advocacy groups. For example, if someone was getting harassed for being transgender, 
you could report what happened to a local LGBT organization that keeps track of this type of data.
* **Check in:** Either during or after the incident, check in with the person who is being harassed and make sure they are doing OK.
