## Question 1
#### Your takeaways from the video
* Dr. BJ Fogg shows us that the key to lasting change does not lie in planning big, monumental changes, but in thinking really, really small.
* He explains  about his work on behavior and how to practice to change people’s behaviors.
*  He told that  he would’ve never expected that a year ago that today he would be doing 70 push-ups a day, 
but all this is part of being obsessed with a behavior.
* If we Practice Continously that behaviour, habits and the daily activities will be automatically changes and Improves.
* The most importany thing is that we need to do is practice changing our own behavior. That gives you an understanding of how behavior works.
## Question 2
#### Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible
* A behavior, according to Fogg, is something you can do right now or at another specific point in time. For instance, you can put your phone
on airplane mode before you got to bed to get a better night’s sleep. 
* B.J. Fogg, Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change Everything
An aspiration, by contrast, is impossible to achieve at any given moment. You cannot suddenly get better sleep. 
* Motivation is your desire to execute your behaviour.
* Ability is your capacity to execute your behaviour.
* prompt is your cue to execute your behaviour.
* To Change the life we need to change our behaviour.

## Question 3
#### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?
* Universal Formula for human behaviour B = MAP 
* M = Motivation
* A = Ability
* P = Prompt

According to Fogg, there are three sources of motivation:
* Yourself, i.e. what you know you want.
* A reward or punishment you know you would receive if you complete the behavior.
* The context, i.e. if people around you are doing it as well.
## Question 4
#### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
* Celebration is the best way to use emotions and create a positive feeling that wires in new habits. It’s free, fast, and available to people of every color, shape, size, income and personality. In addition, celebration teaches us how to be nice to ourselves — a skill that pays out the biggest dividends of all.

* Celebration is habit fertilizer. Each individual celebration strengthens the roots of a specific habit, but the accumulation of celebrations over time is what fertilizes the entire habit garden. By cultivating feelings of success and confidence, we make the soil more inviting and nourishing for all the other habit seeds we want to plant.
## Question 5
#### Your takeaways from the video
* Continuous improvement is a dedication to making small changes and improvements every day, with the expectation that those small improvements will add up to something significant.
* The typical approach to self-improvement is to set a large goal, then try to take big leaps in order to accomplish the goal in as little time as possible. 
James Clear said that In the beginning, there is basically no difference between making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse.But as time goes on, these small improvements or declines compound and you suddenly find a very big gap between people who make slightly better decisions on a daily basis and those who don’t.

**Continuous Improvement Tools**
* Step 1: Do more of what already works.
* Step 2: Avoid tiny losses
* Step 3: Measure backward

## Question 6
#### Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?
There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
* **The first layer is changing your outcomes.** This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.

* **The second layer is changing your process.** This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.

* **The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.** This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.
## Question 7
